# Census ACS Data Analyst

Welcome to the Census ACS Data Analyst GPT project! This OpenAI GPT was created in order to easily ask questions and get answers using Census ACS data.

## Disclaimer
*PLEASE NOTE:* This *is not* a US Census Bureau Product! It is an experimental/independent community project. Feedback welcome

## Project Overview

This project uses ChatGPT to analyze ACS data and provide insights on various demographic, social, and economic aspects. The analysis includes data cleaning, processing, and visualization to help understand and interpret the ACS data effectively.

## Purpose of this Repo

- We are sharing the GPT custom instructions and all files uploaded for transparency and improvement.
- Community feedback and input welcome

## Getting Started

Go to the GPT and start using!
- [ChatGPT Census ACS Data Analyst](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-7OOyAl2VU-census-acs-data-analyst)

### Prerequisites
- OpenAI Account 

### Use with caution!
- This works best as a protyping assistant to help guide through analysis and code
- As much as we want an 'easy button' for answers, output needs human verification
- Your local environment / packages / code base / etc isn't taken into account, so you may have to install new stuff or try other methods

### Known Issues
- There are still issues such as trying to pull columns from ACS 5yr data, but do appear in the 1yr data
- Used the wrong columns and reported the wrong information the first time the code was created. Checking the table metadata to make sure the right columns are referenced in the code is a must.
